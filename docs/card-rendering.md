# Card Rendering

To render a card, the primary step is to obtain a Glimmer component identified by the template tags within the card. A card may contain several Glimmer components, including fields and other miscellaneous components, that are categorized into three formats: isolated, embedded, and edit. These formats determine which component should be rendered. If there are no components available for the isolated or edit formats, the [default format](../packages/base/default-card-component.gts) is used instead. The Glimmer components themselves are building blocks that can be used to create many other things.

## Format
- Isolated format renders a card as a root component.
- Embedded format is useful when a card is embedded within another card.
- Edit format is used when the user wants to update the value of the card.

## Field
A card object can serve as a field within another card object. To establish a card as a field for another card, you can use the @field decorator and specify one of the following field types: `contains`, `containsMany`, `linksTo`, or `linksToMany`. The main difference between a contained field and a linked field is that a linked field refers to another card instance in the realm, whereas a contained field creates a new card instance within the root component of the original card. In other words, a linked field has an identity to refer to, while a contained field doesn't. In edit mode, a contained field will provide inputs for updating its value, while a linked field will provide a modal to search for an existing card instance.

## Rendering process
1. Wrapping a card in Box class as a root component.
2. Getting a glimmer component based on format.
3. Getting fields from the Box class, including field's component.
4. Using fields and box class to instantiate the glimmer component.

## Re-rendering process
Our approach leverages the glimmer invalidation system to trigger card re-rendering. To achieve this, we rely on [TrackedWeakMap implementation](../packages/base/card-api.gts#L136-L138), where each card instance is used as a key. In order to track updates for a field in Glimmer, we entangle it by calling the `.get()` method on a map. When we need to signal to Glimmer that the field needs to be re-rendered, we use the `.set()` method on the same map.
