      "bio": "Luke Melia is a beach volleyball player living in downtown New York City. He is a left-side defender with a good serve and good court sense. What Luke lacks in height, he makes up in heart and craftiness.\n\nOutside of playing beach volleyball, Luke enjoys watching professional beach volleyball, primarily the AVP (the American domestic pro tour) and the FIVB (the world tour). He also enjoys surfing, skateboarding, parkour, and rock climbing.\n\nWhen Luke is not competing or challenging himself physically, he is usually writing code or creating digital products. His languages of choice are Ruby and Javascript.\n\nLuke lives in New York City with his wife and two daughters.",
      "quote": "Some folks say I was born on the wrong coast, that I live a West Coast lifestyle in New York City. But I've found a way to integrate beach volleyball into my life as a New Yorker. I've been lucky enough to play plenty outside of New York, too, from Cali to Bali to Thailand and lots of spots in between. I guess you could say I'm poly-coastal!",
